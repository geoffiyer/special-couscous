MediumBook: Seems bad.
	First step is allocating the N_1 x N_2 cost matrix and filling it out.
	Then you make a lot of copies of this matrix.
	So seems totally unusable for my problem.

Feng: It's all about what to do when you have repeated eigenvalues.
	But I think that we don't care at all for our project.

OLMOS: When they say inexact graph matching they're talking about labels.
	So this isn't useful at all. We want inexact in terms of the
	nodes/edges business (i.e. not a bijection)
