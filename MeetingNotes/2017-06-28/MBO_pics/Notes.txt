Here are some choices for parameters for MBO code

Gloria's norm, Umbrella:
n = whatever
dt = 0.1
lambda = 0.1
sigma = 0.01



Gloria's norm, DFC:  had to try 3-4 times to get it to work
n = whatever
dt = 1
lambda = 0.1
sigma = 0.01



My norm, umbrella:
n = whatever
dt = 0.1
lambda = either 0 or really small
	  1e-10 worked okay but 1e-9 did not
sigma = 1
(also need to add dim1 and dim2)


Synthetic 4class:
./bin/b.exe 4 0.1 0 1 data/test.tiff 3 1
