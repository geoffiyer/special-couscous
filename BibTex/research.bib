abstract={In this paper, we show how inexact graph matching (that is, the correspondence between sets of vertices of pairs of graphs) can be solved using the renormalization of projections of the vertices (as defined in this case by their connectivities) into the joint eigenspace of a pair of graphs and a form of relational clustering. An important feature of this eigenspace renormalization projection clustering (EPC) method is its ability to match graphs with different number of vertices. Shock graph-based shape matching is used to illustrate the model and a more objective method for evaluating the approach using random graphs is explored with encouraging results.},

abstract="Graphs provide an efficient tool for object representation in various machine learning applications. Once graph-based representations are constructed, an important question is how to compare graphs. This problem is often formulated as a graph matching problem where one seeks a mapping between vertices of two graphs which optimally aligns their structure. In the classical formulation of graph matching, only one-to-one correspondences between vertices are considered. However, in many applications, graphs cannot be matched perfectly and it is more interesting to consider many-to-many correspondences where clusters of vertices in one graph are matched to clusters of vertices in the other graph. In this paper, we formulate the many-to-many graph matching problem as a discrete optimization problem and propose two approximate algorithms based on alternative continuous relaxations of the combinatorial problem. We compare new methods with other existing methods on several benchmark datasets.",

abstract = "Abstract The intrinsic information of a graph can be fully encoded into its spectrum and corresponding eigenvectors of its adjacency matrix, which provides a solid foundation for the success of spectral graph matching methods. The spectral multiplicity, however, may significantly affect the matching accuracy. In this paper, we propose a spectral-multiplicity-tolerant graph matching approach. We start from modeling the spectral multiplicity in the matching error measurement. Next, we address the equal-size graph matching problem, and show how to establish the vertex-to-vertex correspondence by alternatively optimizing the multiplicity matrix C and the permutation matrix P. We also propose a reliable initialization method to make the iterative optimization process converge rapidly. Then, we extend the algorithm to unequal-size graph matching by optimally warping two graphs into the same size. A comprehensive performance evaluation has been conducted on a large synthetic dataset. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on shape retrieval. The experimental results show that compared with existing methods, the proposed approach is more robust to noise and structural corruption and has a comparable complexity."

abstract={We propose a convex-concave programming approach for the labeled weighted graph matching problem. The convex-concave programming formulation is obtained by rewriting the weighted graph matching problem as a least-square problem on the set of permutation matrices and relaxing it to two different optimization problems: a quadratic convex and a quadratic concave optimization problem on the set of doubly stochastic matrices. The concave relaxation has the same global minimum as the initial graph matching problem, but the search for its global minimum is also a hard combinatorial problem. We, therefore, construct an approximation of the concave problem solution by following a solution path of a convex-concave problem obtained by linear interpolation of the convex and concave formulations, starting from the convex relaxation. This method allows to easily integrate the information on graph label similarities into the optimization problem, and therefore, perform labeled weighted graph matching. The algorithm is compared with some of the best performing graph matching methods on four data sets: simulated graphs, QAPLib, retina vessel images, and handwritten Chinese characters. In all cases, the results are competitive with the state of the art.},

With the aim of efficiently and accurately matching the large graphs common in big data, we present our graph matching algorithm, the Fast Approximate Quadratic assignment algorithm. We empirically demonstrate that our algorithm is faster and achieves a lower objective value on over 80\% of the QAPLIB benchmark library, compared with the previous state-of-the-art. Applying our algorithm to our motivating example, matching C. elegans connectomes (brain-graphs), we find that it efficiently achieves performance.}

The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We applied this approach to segmenting static images, as well as motion sequences, and found the results to be very encouraging},

In contrast to most multiscale image processing, this algorithm works on multiple scales of the image in parallel, without iteration, to capture both coarse and fine level details. The algorithm is computationally efficient, allowing to segment large images. We use the normalized cut graph partitioning framework of image segmentation. We construct a graph encoding pairwise pixel affinity, and partition the graph for image segmentation. We demonstrate that large image graphs can be compressed into multiple scales capturing image structure at increasingly large neighborhood. We show that the decomposition of the image segmentation graph into different scales can be determined by ecological statistics on the image grouping cues. Our segmentation algorithm works simultaneously across the graph scales, with an inter-scale constraint to ensure communication and consistency between the segmentations at each scale. As the results show, we incorporate long-range connections with linear-time complexity, providing high-quality segmentations efficiently. Images that previously could not be processed because of their size have been accurately segmented thanks to this method.},

abstract={The luminance of a natural scene is often of high dynamic range (HDR). In this paper, we propose a new scheme to handle HDR scenes by integrating locally adaptive scene detail capture and suppressing gradient reversals introduced by the local adaptation. The proposed scheme is novel for capturing an HDR scene by using a standard dynamic range (SDR) device and synthesizing an image suitable for SDR displays. In particular, we use an SDR capture device to record scene details (i.e., the visible contrasts and the scene gradients) in a series of SDR images with different exposure levels. Each SDR image responds to a fraction of the HDR and partially records scene details. With the captured SDR image series, we first calculate the image luminance levels, which maximize the visible contrasts, and then the scene gradients embedded in these images. Next, we synthesize an SDR image by using a probabilistic model that preserves the calculated image luminance levels and suppresses reversals in the image luminance gradients. The synthesized SDR image contains much more scene details than any of the captured SDR image. Moreover, the proposed scheme also functions as the tone mapping of an HDR image to the SDR image, and it is superior to both global and local tone mapping operators. This is because global operators fail to preserve visual details when the contrast ratio of a scene is large, whereas local operators often produce halos in the synthesized SDR image.

title={Robust Multi-Exposure Image Fusion: A Structural Patch Decomposition Approach}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={PP}, 
number={99}, 
pages={1-1}, 
abstract={We propose a simple yet effective structural patch decomposition (SPD) approach for multi-exposure image fusion (MEF) that is robust to ghosting effect. We decompose an image patch into three conceptually independent components: signal strength, signal structure, and mean intensity. Upon fusing these three components separately, we reconstruct a desired patch and place it back into the fused image. This novel patch decomposition approach benefits MEF in many aspects. First, as opposed to most pixel-wise MEF methods, the proposed algorithm does not require post-processing steps to improve visual quality or to reduce spatial artifacts. Second, it handles RGB color channels jointly and thus produces fused images with more vivid color appearance. Third and most importantly, the direction of the signal structure component in the patch vector space provides ideal information for ghost removal. It allows us to reliably and efficiently reject inconsistent object motions w.r.t. a chosen reference image without performing computationally expensive motion estimation.We compare the proposed algorithm with 12 MEF methods on 21 static scenes and 12 deghosting schemes on 19 dynamic scenes (with camera and object motion). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only outperforms previous MEF algorithms on static scenes but also consistently produces high quality fused images with little ghosting artifacts for dynamic scenes. Moreover, it maintains a lower computational cost compared with state-of-the- art deghosting schemes.},

% \cite{Wattuya2008} is about segmentation fusion. Take two segmentations of the

% fuse them. Honestly though this is pretty close to what we're doing. They define

The aim is twofold: (i) to reframe the multiresolution-based fusion methodology into a common formalism and, within this framework, (ii) to develop a new region-based approach which combines aspects of both object and pixel-level fusion. To this end, we first present a general framework which encompasses most of the existing multiresolution-based fusion schemes and provides freedom to create new ones. Then, we extend this framework to allow a region-based fusion approach. The basic idea is to make a multiresolution segmentation based on all different input images and to use this segmentation to guide the fusion process. Performance assessment is also addressed and future directions and open problems are discussed as well. "

abstract={We propose a new binary partition tree (BPT)-based framework for multi-class segmentation of remote sensing images. In the literature, BPTs are typically computed in a bottom-up manner based on spectral similarities, then analyzed to extract image objects. When image objects exhibit a considerable internal spectral variability, it often happens that such objects are composed of several disjoint regions in the BPT, yielding errors in object extraction. We pose the multi-class segmentation problem as an energy minimization task and solve it by using BPTs. Our main contribution consists in introducing a new dissimilarity function for the tree construction, which combines both spectral discrepancies and supervised class-specific information to take into account the within-class spectral variability. The experimental validation proved that the proposed method constitutes a competitive alternative for object-based image classification.},

abstract="Integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an open problem, which has motivated many researches. The most important challenge in EEG-fMRI integration is the unknown relationship between these two modalities. In this paper, we extract the same features (spatial map of neural activity) from both modality. Therefore, the proposed integration method does not need any assumption about the relationship of EEG and fMRI. We present a source localization method from scalp EEG signal using jointly fMRI analysis results as prior spatial information and source separation for providing temporal courses of sources of interest. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated quantitatively along with multiple sparse priors method and sparse Bayesian learning with the fMRI results as prior information. Localization bias and source distribution index are used to measure the performance of different localization approaches with or without a variety of fMRI-EEG mismatches on simulated realistic data. The method is also applied to experimental data of face perception of 16 subjects. Simulation results show that the proposed method is significantly stable against the noise with low localization bias. Although the existence of an extra region in the fMRI data enlarges localization bias, the proposed method outperforms the other methods. Conversely, a missed region in the fMRI data does not affect the localization bias of the common sources in the EEG-fMRI data. Results on experimental data are congruent with previous studies and produce clusters in the fusiform and occipital face areas (FFA and OFA, respectively). Moreover, it shows high stability in source localization against variations in different subjects.",

	abstract = {Given a discrete sample of event locations, we wish to produce a probability density that models the relative probability of events occurring in a spatial domain. Standard density estimation techniques do not incorporate priors informed by spatial data. Such methods can result in assigning significant positive probability to locations where events cannot realistically occur. In particular, when modelling residential burglaries, standard density estimation can predict residential burglaries occurring where there are no residences. Incorporating the spatial data can inform the valid region for the density. When modelling very few events, additional priors can help to correctly fill in the gaps. Learning and enforcing correlation between spatial data and event data can yield better estimates from fewer events. We propose a non-local version of maximum penalized likelihood estimation based on the H1 Sobolev seminorm regularizer that computes non-local weights from spatial data to obtain more spatially accurate density estimates. We evaluate this method in application to a residential burglary dataset from San Fernando Valley with the non-local weights informed by housing data or a satellite image.},

title="A tutorial on spectral clustering",
journal="Statistics and Computing",
year="2007",
volume="17",
number="4",
pages="395--416",
abstract="In recent years, spectral clustering has become one of the most popular modern clustering algorithms. It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.",
