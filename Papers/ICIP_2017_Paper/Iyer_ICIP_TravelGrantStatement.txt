"Please explain succinctly (1) how important the travel grant is to your attendance to the conference; (2) justifications for the requested amount; and (3) how you can ensure the quality of the presentation of your paper(s) with or without the travel grant."

(1)

Without a travel grant, it is unlikely that I would be able to attend the conference. The grant supporting this our paper is also covering multiple UCLA graduate students, and there are no extra funds available for travel.

(2)

We are requesting $750 to help cover plane tickets and hotel costs.

(3)

Regardless of the amount of travel funds provided, our second author, Jocelyn Chanussot, will be attending the conference. If I am unable to attend, he will present the work for our group.
